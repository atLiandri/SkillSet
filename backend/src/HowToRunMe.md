Hi Team,

This was generated with the tool Scaffold-ETH 2
To run this env:
1) in a terminal type yarn chain (this is your local blockchain)
2) in an other terminal type yarn deploy (deploy on your local blockchain)
3) in an other terminal type yar start (to start the frontend to access the debug view)

Go at http://localhost:3000 (It is like the runtime env to iterate)
Click on Debug Contracts, You shold see 3 contracts. SkillSetContract is the good one.
Click on SkillSetContract
You see a debugging GUI

The contract is in the folder
./backend/src/packages/hardhat/contracts/SkillSetContract.sol

The others contracts are
SkillSet.sol a version of contract before I saw the md file have instructions
YourContract.sol is the default generated contract by the tool
